# SRAtoolkits-in-python
This code allows to use SRAtoolkit in python to download high performance sequences of large sizes.
SRAtoolkit is NCBI software, so you need to download it and add it to your computer's environment variables.
To use it you just have to replace the marked lines with the sequence ID and the paths of the directories where you want to save the sequence.
